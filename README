Features:
 - an MSP430F5510 uC controls all aspects of charging a 12v Pb battery
 - programming either via spy-bi-wire or usb (untested)
 - logging capability to a uSd card
 - backup 3v Li cell for keeping the RTC up-to-date
 - analog readout of battery voltage, input voltage, charge current, thermistor temperature, internal temperature
 - possibility to stop the charge if a condition is met
 - 8 status leds for verbose blinkiness
 - very low quiescent current

rev1 used a LandStar charge controller that got replaced in rev3 with a PB137ACV ic
